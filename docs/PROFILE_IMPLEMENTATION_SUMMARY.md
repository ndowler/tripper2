## 🔧 Technical Details

### Architecture
- **Modular Components**: Each section is a separate component
- **Store Integration**: Connected to tripStore for vibes
- **Supabase Integration**: Uses Supabase Auth for security operations
- **TypeScript**: Fully typed with interfaces
- **No Linter Errors**: Clean code passing all checks

### Dependencies Used
- `@/lib/supabase/client` - Supabase client for auth operations
- `@/lib/store/tripStore` - Zustand store for vibes
- `@/lib/types/vibes` - UserVibes types and VIBE_PACKS
- `@/components/ui/*` - shadcn/ui components (Button, Input, Card, Dialog, Badge)
- `lucide-react` - Icons (User, Shield, Sparkles, Edit, etc.)
- `sonner` - Toast notifications

### Key Patterns Used
1. **Component Composition**: Main page composes smaller components
2. **Props Pattern**: Components receive necessary data as props
3. **Callback Pattern**: Components call callbacks for side effects
4. **Modal Pattern**: Dialogs for sensitive operations (password, email change)
5. **Loading States**: Disabled states and loading text during async operations
6. **Error Handling**: Try/catch with user-friendly error messages

### Visual Design
- Clean card-based layout
