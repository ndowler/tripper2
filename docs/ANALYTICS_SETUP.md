# Analytics Setup Guide

## PostHog Configuration

Tripper now has comprehensive analytics tracking via PostHog. This document explains how to set it up and what's being tracked.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Create a PostHog Account

1. Go to [https://posthog.com](https://posthog.com)
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Create a new project for Tripper
4. Get your Project API Key from Project Settings

### 2. Add Environment Variables

Add these to your `.env.local` file:

```bash
# PostHog Analytics
NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY=phc_your_project_key_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_HOST=https://app.posthog.com
```

**Note:** The `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix means these are exposed to the client-side code. This is safe for PostHog keys as they're designed for client-side use.

### 3. Restart Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

### 4. Test Analytics

1. Open the app in your browser
2. You should see a cookie consent banner at the bottom
3. Click "Accept" to enable analytics
4. Perform some actions (create a trip, add cards, use command palette)
5. Check your PostHog dashboard to see events coming in

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY=phc_production_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_HOST=https://app.posthog.com
```

## Troubleshooting

### Events Not Showing Up
1. Check browser console for "PostHog initialized" log
2. Verify environment variables are set
3. Ensure you've accepted the cookie consent
4. Check PostHog dashboard live events view
5. Wait 1-2 minutes for events to process

### Cookie Consent Not Showing
1. Clear localStorage: `localStorage.clear()`
2. Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R
3. Check browser console for errors

### PostHog Debug Mode
In development, PostHog automatically enables debug mode. Check console for:
- `[Analytics] PostHog initialized`
- `[Analytics] Event Name {properties}`

## Cost Estimates

### Free Tier
- 1 million events per month
- Unlimited projects
- 1 year data retention
- Core features included

### Paid Tier (if needed)
- $0.00031 per event after 1M
- ~$300 for 1M additional events
- 7 years data retention
- Advanced features

### Estimated Usage for Tripper
- 1,000 active users = ~500K events/month (within free tier)
- 10,000 active users = ~5M events/month (~$1,200/month)
- 100,000 active users = ~50M events/month (~$15,000/month)

## Useful PostHog Queries

### New Users This Week
```
event = "User Signed Up"
timestamp > -7d
```

### Command Palette Usage Rate
```
(count where event = "Command Palette Opened") / (count distinct users)
```

### Average AI Generation Time
```
avg(properties.duration) where event = "Discover Completed"
```

### Signup to First Trip Funnel
```
1. User Signed Up
2. Trip Created
```
