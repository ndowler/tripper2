## üêõ Known Issues

**None currently** - All phases tested and working

---

## üí° Things to Remember

### When Adding New Features
1. Update types in `lib/types/index.ts`
2. Update schemas in `lib/schemas/index.ts`
3. Add constants to `lib/constants.ts` if needed
4. Add service methods in `lib/services/` if data access needed
5. Update store actions in `lib/store/tripStore.ts`
6. Create components in appropriate subdirectory
7. Test Supabase persistence (+ localStorage fallback)
8. Update database schema in `lib/supabase/database.sql` if needed
9. Verify responsive design
10. Check for linter errors
11. Test with authenticated and unauthenticated states

### When Working with AI
- Use GPT-4o-mini for suggestions (cheap, fast)
- Schema anchoring in system prompt
- Salvage validation (accept 10-20 valid)
- Temperature: 0.7 for creativity
- Max tokens: 4000 for complex outputs

### When Working with Store
- Use Immer for immutable updates
- Enable temporal middleware for undo/redo
- Debounce localStorage writes (500ms)
- Sync to Supabase after state changes (via services)
- Clear sensitive data on logout
- Handle optimistic updates with rollback on failure

## üéì Learning & Insights

### What Went Well
- **dnd-kit** is fantastic for drag & drop
- **Zustand + Immer** is perfect for React state
- **Zod** catches errors early with schema validation
- **shadcn/ui** speeds up UI development dramatically
- **Command palette** makes power users incredibly productive
- **AI integration** is surprisingly reliable with good prompts

### What Could Be Better
- Need better error messages for AI failures
- Could optimize bundle size (currently ~300KB)
- Mobile touch targets could be larger (44px+)
- Need to add loading skeletons for perceived performance
- Could add more keyboard shortcuts

### Technical Debt
- **None currently** - Code is clean and well-structured
- Consider code splitting for AI features (future optimization)
- Git status behind origin/dev by 18 commits - need to sync
- Many uncommitted changes - need to commit Phase 4.4

## üìû Getting Help

### If Something Breaks
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify `.env.local` has `OPENAI_API_KEY`
3. Clear localStorage: `localStorage.clear()`
4. Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R
5. Check `package.json` dependencies

### Documentation References
- `README.md` - Quick start and features
