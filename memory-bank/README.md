# Tripper Memory Bank

**Purpose:** Long-term project memory and context for AI assistants and developers  
**Last Updated:** October 6, 2025  
**Project Status:** Phase 4.3 Complete, 65% to v1.0

---

## 📖 What is this?

The **Memory Bank** is a living documentation system that captures the complete context of the Tripper project. It serves as:

1. **AI Assistant Context** - Helps AI understand project state without re-discovering
2. **Onboarding Resource** - New developers can quickly understand the codebase
3. **Project History** - Tracks decisions, progress, and learnings
4. **Decision Log** - Documents why technologies and patterns were chosen

## 📂 Memory Bank Structure

### Core Documents

| File | Purpose | Update Frequency |
|------|---------|------------------|
| **README.md** | This file - explains memory bank | Rarely |
| **activeContext.md** | Current state, recent changes, next steps | Every session |
| **productContext.md** | Product vision, features, user flows | When features change |
| **systemPatterns.md** | Architecture, patterns, conventions | When patterns evolve |
| **progress.md** | Completed phases, roadmap | After each phase |
| **techStack.md** | Technologies, dependencies, rationale | When stack changes |

2. Read `activeContext.md` (current state)
3. Read `productContext.md` (product vision)
4. Run `npm install && npm run dev`
5. Open http://localhost:3000/demo

**Before Coding:**
1. Read `systemPatterns.md` (patterns and conventions)
2. Check `progress.md` (what's been built)

- ✅ Read activeContext.md at the start of every session
- ✅ Update activeContext.md at the end of every session
- ✅ Reference memory bank when making decisions
- ✅ Keep updates concise and focused
- ✅ Use consistent formatting

## 📐 Document Structure Guidelines

### Use Clear Headings
```markdown
# Top-level (document title)
## Major sections
### Subsections
#### Details
```

### Use Consistent Formatting
- **Bold** for emphasis and field names
- `code` for code, filenames, commands
- > Blockquotes for important notes
- Lists for items, steps, features
- Tables for structured data

### Use Visual Elements
- ✅ ❌ for success/failure
- 🎯 📊 📝 for section types
- Code blocks for examples
- Diagrams for architecture (ASCII art)

- Bullet points for lists
- Clear section breaks with `---`
- Tables for comparisons
