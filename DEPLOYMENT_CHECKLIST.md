- [ ] Update dependencies (`npm audit fix`)
- [ ] Review and update documentation
- [ ] Plan new features based on user requests

## Rollback Plan

If something goes wrong after deployment:

1. **Quick Fix**: Revert to previous deployment in Vercel
   - Go to Deployments tab
   - Find last working deployment
   - Click "..." â†’ "Promote to Production"

2. **Database Issue**: Restore from Supabase backup
   - Go to Database â†’ Backups
   - Select backup before the issue
   - Restore

3. **Environment Variable Issue**: Double-check all variables
   - Verify no typos
   - Ensure values are correct
   - Redeploy after fixing

## Common Issues & Solutions

### "Invalid JWT" Error
- **Cause**: Wrong Supabase credentials
- **Fix**: Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

### Authentication Redirect Loop
- **Cause**: Wrong redirect URL in Supabase
- **Fix**: Add `https://your-domain.com/auth/callback` to Supabase redirect URLs

### AI Suggestions Not Working
- **Cause**: OpenAI API key issue or no credits
- **Fix**: Verify API key and check OpenAI dashboard for credits

### Data Migration Fails
- **Cause**: RLS policies or network issue
- **Fix**: Check browser console, verify RLS policies, test with different user
