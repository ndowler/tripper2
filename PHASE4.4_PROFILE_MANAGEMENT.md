## üí° Technical Decisions

### Why Component Modularity?
**Decision**: Split profile into 3 separate components instead of one large component

**Rationale**:
- Easier to maintain and test
- Better code organization
- Can reuse components elsewhere
- Clear separation of concerns
- Follows React best practices

### Why Not Avatar Upload Yet?
**Decision**: Placeholder for photo upload, not implemented

**Rationale**:
- Focus on core functionality first
- Need to set up Supabase Storage
- Can add in future phase
- Initials avatar works well as fallback

### Why Separate Preferences Pages?
**Decision**: Keep `/preferences` for detailed editing, `/profile` for summary

**Rationale**:
- `/preferences` has comprehensive controls (sliders, multi-select, etc.)
- `/profile` is for quick overview and navigation hub
- Avoids overwhelming users with too much on one page
- Clear user journey: view summary ‚Üí edit details

### Why Password Verification?
**Decision**: Verify current password before changing

**Rationale**:
- Security best practice
- Prevents unauthorized password changes
- User must prove they know current password
- Standard pattern in account management
